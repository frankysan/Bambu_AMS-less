This projects aims to document the default functionality of the Bambu Lab-specific G-code included in Orca Slicer, and provide alternatives. One such alternative is the ability to change filaments manually, while still retaining the flushing and nozzle priming sequences.

The modified files should work with Bambu Studio as well, but I have not tested it there yet.

NOTE: I generally do NOT recommend just copying and pasting any G-code you find online into your slicer! The code in this repo has been tested so far only by me personally and while it works fine for me, I give NO guarantees it will work for you. So please use these and any other modified G-code files with caution.
